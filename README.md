# AdventOfCode

## Introduction
Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! :)
I'm going to try my best to tackle the daily coding challenges presented [here](https://adventofcode.com/), a series of fun, themed, and engaging programming puzzles. 
2023 is my first time trying it out, wish me luck!
I'm also using this time to better learn good practices in github simultaneously.
As of making this, I'm unsure I can complete all of the challenges, but I will absolutely try!

## Project Structure
This repository is organized by day, with each day's challenge having its own folder.
Inside each day's folder, you'll find two files. I'm aiming to use Python, but I may switch up the language if I feel it is better used for some case.
- `Day1/Star1.py`
- `Day1/Star2.py`
- `Day2/Star1.py`
- ...
- `Day25/Star1.py`
- `Day25/Star2.py`

## How to Use
To check out the solutions:
1. Navigate to the folder for the day you're interested in.
2. Open either the `Star1.py` or `Star2.py` to see my given solution for that part of the challenge.
